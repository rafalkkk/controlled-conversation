This extension works for MS Edge. Sometimes administrators in corporate environment force some setting 
on users’ browsers. One of such settings is a home page open when you start a new tab. 
This setting cannot be changed by a user, as it is managed by the administrator. 
This extension will not disable that setting, but when you open a new tab it will quickly load a www.google.com page. 
You should not see the ugly, slow loading company home page, instead a google page will be displayed. 
You can change the home page in the background.js file slightly modifying the file, as described below.

<p>The quotes below are from a Polish comedy "Controlled conversations" (org. "Rozmowy kontrolowane") 
and situation like a blocked home page is in my opinion equally nonsese like the situation presented in the movie.</p>
<p>Zyrafy wchodza do szafy</p>
<p>Pawiany wchodza na sciany</p>
<p>Indyki wpadaja we wnyki</p>
<p>Ryby plywają na niby</p>
<p>Do obrony domowej strony!</p>
