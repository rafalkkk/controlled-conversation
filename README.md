# Controlled Conversation

This extension works for MS Edge. Sometimes administrators in corporate environment force some setting on usersâ€™ browsers. 
One of such settings is a home page open when you start a new tab. 
This setting cannot be changed by a user, as it is managed by the administrator. 
This extension will not disable that setting, but when you open a new tab it will quickly load a www.google.com page. 
You should not see the ugly, slow loading company home page, instead a google page will be displayed. 
You can change the home page in the background.js file slightly modifying the file, as described below.
